## CRITICAL: Language Immutability

⚠️ **DO NOT CHANGE THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OF THIS REPOSITORY**

This repository is an **Elixir LSP server** leveraging the BEAM VM.
- The implementation language MUST remain Elixir
- Do NOT port, rewrite, or translate to Rust, Go, TypeScript, Python, or any other language
- Do NOT change the repository description or technical approach
- Elixir + BEAM provides: hot code reload, supervision trees, process isolation, fault tolerance
- The language and architecture are fundamental to the project's design

## Repository Focus
- This is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in Elixir
- Uses GenLSP framework for LSP compliance
- Adapters run as isolated GenServer processes under supervision
- Follow Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) conventions

## Workflow
1. Inspect `STATE.scm` for current state, blockers, and next actions
2. Respect constraints in `META.scm` architecture decisions
3. After finishing edits, update STATE.scm and commit with imperative message
4. Never commit node_modules or build artifacts

## Code Quality
- Run `just quality` before committing (fmt, lint, dialyzer)
- Maintain SPDX headers (PMPL-1.0-or-later)
- Use correct author: Jonathan D.A. Jewell <jonathan.jewell@open.ac.uk>
- Keep adapters isolated in separate GenServer processes

## Testing
- Write ExUnit tests for all adapters
- Test LSP protocol compliance
- Mock external CLI tools in tests
- Run `just test` before pushing

## Delivery Promises
- Mention if STATE.scm, checkpoints, or workflows changed
- Keep this file in sync with repository governance
